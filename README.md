# show-pi
Show the digits of π in a fun way via terminal output.

Intended to be run as part of a demonstration about the number π. Zoom in your terminal, run show_pi.py and watch in amazement as the number gets longer and longer, faster and faster!

The work of calculating the digits is done by the wonderful [pidigits](https://github.com/transmogrifier/pidigits).
